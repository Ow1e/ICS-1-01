This project turns mp4s into frames, which are read and turned into ASCII Escape Codes and Strings and then extracted into SmallBasic (its a stupid requirement).

## Inputing data
The `video_to_frames.py` file slices data into frames and sets a resolution, every video is different so you will have the `SLICE` variable.

## JSON
The `frames.json` file can get stupidly big, so no harm deleting it.

## Why Extract to Microsoft SmallBasic
Its a course requirement, but I can generate code with other software.
